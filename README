PPerl
=====

PPerl provides a persistent environment for perl scripts. It makes converting
a useful old script into a persistent daemon process a breeze.

Simply change your shebang line to #!/usr/bin/pperl, rather than "perl", and
you'll find your old slow scripts that take ages to start up, running like
they were brand spanking new again. Well, that's the plan at least!
