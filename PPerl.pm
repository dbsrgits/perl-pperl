=head1 NAME

PPerl - Make perl scripts persistent in memory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ pperl foo.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program turns ordinary perl scripts into long running daemons, making
subsequent executions extremely fast. It forks several processes for each
script, allowing many proceses to call the script at once.

It works a lot like SpeedyCGI, but is written a little differently. I didn't
use the SpeedyCGI codebase, because I couldn't get it to compile, and needed
something ASAP.

The easiest way to use this is to change your shebang line from:

  #!/usr/bin/perl -w

To use pperl instead:

  #!/usr/bin/pperl -w

=head1 WARNINGS

Like other persistent environments, this one has problems with things like
BEGIN blocks, global variables, etc. So beware, and try checking the mod_perl
guide at http://perl.apache.org/guide/ for lots of information that applies
to many persistent perl environments.

=head1 Parameters

  $ pperl <perl params> -- <pperl params> scriptname <script params>

The perl params are sent to the perl binary the first time it is started up.
See L<perlrun> for details.

The pperl params control how pperl works. Try -h for an overview.

The script params are passed to the script on every invocation. The script
also gets any current environment variables, the current working directory,
and everything on STDIN.

=head1 Killing

In order to kill a currently running PPerl process, use:

  pperl -- -k <scriptname>

You need to make sure the path to the script is the same as when it was invoked.

Alternatively look for a .pid file for the script in your tmp directory, and
kill (with SIGINT) the process with that PID.

=head1 BUGS

The process does not reload when the script or modules change.

$^S is not represented identically with respect to perl, since your
script will be run within an eval block
