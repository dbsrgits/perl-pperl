Revision history for Perl extension PPerl.

0.15
    - Minor fixes
    
0.14
    - Switched entire model to pass fd's over the socket, rather than
      all of STDIN/STDOUT. This means we no longer have to do lots of
      messing with select() - it all just "works". Many beers to
      RichardC for this work.

0.13
    - Implement wide-open sockets (for people who need to run the same
      script as different users). Note this may have bad security "issues".
    - Turn off strict for actual script (script may turn it on again).
    - More help page stuff
